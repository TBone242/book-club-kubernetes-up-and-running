## Discussion Topics

I (Tom P.) met with 5 others to discuss the basics of how the group would operate. We
decided on the following:

- We would meet once a week
- We would cover one chapter a week

We also dicussed the best tool for video conferencing. Zoom worked fairly well today,
but we may end up switching to MS Teams or Jitsi.

Finally, we discussed the best way to setup a learning Kubernetes environment. I
mentioned that I heard good things about Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) and that I
had had luck running Rancher on my Debian 10 home server.

Our next meeting is 4/1 from 12:00 - 12:40.
